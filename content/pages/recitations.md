Breakout groups

- *You will be divided into groups and will do readings based on your group. Make sure to come to recitation have read and digested all the readings.*
- *Breakout groups on what the state should do, and how. For groups C–F, articulate clearly what the nature of the public good or public service is that you believe the state should provide. Then review how it can best be provided to minimize the likelihood of state abuse.*
- *Bear in mind that the audience for your presentations is your fellow students, not me or the TA. You want them to come away from your presentation with a sense of the big questions related to your topic and what alternatives there might be. Remember that they will not have done any of the readings that your group did, so you will need to summarize and explain that material. I suggest that you use the blackboard to write the definition of the public good ahead of time so people can see it as you begin, and perhaps an outline of the points you will cover.*
- *If your group does not agree, don’t try to force consensus.* *Instead, use the disagreement to refine the pros and cons of different approaches, and then note that you didn’t all agree on how these pros and cons netted out.*
- *In all cases, assume that your state will make and enforce binding decisions for a population of around six million people, about four and a half million of whom are adults.*
- *The TA will overexplain the task, but ask plenty of questions before you begin your discussions and if you get stuck.*

Group A: Lessons from Athens. The institutions invented in the ancient Greek world approximately 2,500 years ago were distinctive in providing direct citizen control of government. You should focus here on the notion of authoritative bodies (essentially, state agencies) being staffed by randomly selected groups of citizens and the citizenry meeting regularly to vote on decisions. Are these feasible in modern societies, either at the national or local level, and for certain spheres of policy? What are the pros and cons of applying them?

Group B: The use of referenda in modern societies. Focus here on the idea of the citizenry meeting regularly (in person or virtually) to vote directly on policy decisions. Are these feasible in modern societies. If so, for what spheres of policy or types of decisions? What are the pros and cons of applying them?

- Dahl, Robert A.  “Towards the Second Transformation: Republicanism, Representation, and the Logic of Equality.” Chapter 2 in *Democracy and Its Critics.* Yale University Press, 1991, pp. 28–30.

- Schmitter, Philippe C. [“A Proposal for the Creation of a 'Citizen Assembly'.”(PDF)](https://www.eui.eu/Documents/DepartmentsCentres/SPS/Profiles/Schmitter/CitizenAssembly.pdf)

Group C: External defense. What sort of institutions are required and desirable for the defense of your country in a modern context. For instance, does “defense” include power projection abroad for national advantage? Protections of allies? Ensuring access to strategic resources and trade routes? Conquest and other wars of choice abroad? Then think about provision of this good: the value of a draft *versus* an all-volunteer army *versus* reliance on (foreign) mercenaries *versus* a small constabulary force backed by citizen-militias, etc.

Group D: Justice and punishment. Begin from first principles: how should the state punish infractions? You should feel free to consider alternative approaches to deterrence and punishment in general that rely on community shaming, community service, etc. Note that you may wish to apply the notion of “restorative justice” to certain types of crimes and certain types of communities- for instance, involuntary homicide, fraud, or sexual misconduct between individuals who know each other. Whatever you decide, make sure you clearly articulate the fundamental options for the class.
