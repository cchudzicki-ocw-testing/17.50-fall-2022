#### Class Objectives

This class addresses the fundamental problems of governance: the rationale for the state and ways to make sure that the state does what is in the best interests of people subject to its authority. The central purpose of the class is to help you think critically about these issues, which will include interrogating the assumptions that you – like everyone else – probably have about them.

The class also has a few corollary goals:

- To help you identify improvements in how your country could be governed
- to help you make and critique arguments about public policy and social issues, based on analytical reasoning and empirical evidence
- to give you practice in writing and presentation
- to provide the foundation for more specialized polisci classes, if you wish to take them

#### Readings

Readings are listed under the specific session for which they are required. There is a logic to the choice of sessions and to the order in which readings are listed. Readings total 50–100 pages per week and should take you at most 4 hours to do. If you have trouble completing the readings in that time, please see me the instructors about strategies.
