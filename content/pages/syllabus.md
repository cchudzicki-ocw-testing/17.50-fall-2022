#### Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week; 1 hour / session

Recitations: 1 session / week; 1 hour / session

#### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this course.

#### Class Objectives

This class addresses the fundamental problems of governance: the rationale for the state and ways to make sure that the state does what is in the best interests of people subject to its authority. The central purpose of the class is to help you think critically about these issues, which will include interrogating the assumptions that you – like everyone else – probably have about them.

The class also has a few corollary goals:

- To help you identify improvements in how your country could be governed
- to help you make and critique arguments about public policy and social issues, based on analytical reasoning and empirical evidence
- to give you practice in writing and presentation
- to provide the foundation for more specialized polisci classes, if you wish to take them

#### Readings

Readings are listed under the specific session for which they are required. There is a logic to the choice of sessions and to the order in which readings are listed. Readings total 50–100 pages per week and should take you at most 4 hours to do. If you have trouble completing the readings in that time, please see me or the teaching assistant about strategies.

See the {{% resource_link "5766748f-26ce-4690-8413-aba30fb6b353" "Readings" %}} section for further detail.

#### Recommended Novels, Films, and TV

There are a lot of terrific films and novels out there with a political theme.

#### Class Participation

This subject is designed so that there is extensive class participation. The first day of each week normally involves more in the way of lecture from me to frame the salient issues, provide the necessary background for those unfamiliar with the topic, and generally make sure everyone is on the same page. The second session of each week and the recitation typically involve much more student participation, in the form of breakout groups and presentations. Even the lectures, however, are usually interactive.

I’d ask that you be prepared to participate actively and intelligently in class throughout the semester. For some people, that may mean pushing yourself to talk more than feels instinctively comfortable; for others it may mean holding yourself back. If participation becomes unbalanced, I may “cold call” people.

In formal presentations, there is a strict time limit, so be sure to practice and to time yourself ahead of time; you should make sure to frame your question clearly in the beginning and then move on swiftly to your main points. ***A list of hints for making good presentations is posted on the website***; please go through it before our talk to make sure you have not missed anything. In general, everyone in a breakout group must present.

Several class sessions are devoted to breakout groups. We will check informally throughout the semester to make sure that everyone is pulling their weight in the breakout groups and adjust participation grades accordingly. If you are concerned that your group cannot reach consensus on any point, you should not try to force one. Rather, use the division in your group to sharpen your argumentation and to highlight the pros and cons of different options. Basically, imagine that you are teeing the issue up for a decision-maker.
